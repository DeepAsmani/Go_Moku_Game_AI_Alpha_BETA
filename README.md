# Go_Moku_Game_AI_Alpha_BETA

Gomoku, also called Five in a Row, is an abstract strategy board game. It is traditionally played with Go pieces (black and white stones) on a Go board. It is played using a 15×15 board while in the past a 19×19 board was standard. Because pieces are typically not moved or removed from the board, Gomoku may also be played as a paper-and-pencil game. The game is known in several countries under different names.

Players alternate turns placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection. Black plays first. The winner is the first player to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Placing so that a line of more than five stones of the same color is created does not result in a win. These are called overlines.
Gomoku has a strong advantage for the first player when unrestricted.

Introduction 

The field of game intelligence has seen an increase in player centric research. That is, machine learning techniques are employed in games with the objective of providing an entertaining and satisfying game experience for the human player. This paper proposes an adaptive game AI that can scale its level of difficulty according to the human player's level of capability for the game freestyle Gomoku. The proposed algorithm scales the level of difficulty during the game and between games based on how well the human player is performing such that it will not be too easy or too difficult. The adaptive game AI was sent out to 50 human respondents as feasibility. It was observed that the adaptive AI was able to successfully scale the level of difficulty to match that of the human player, and the human player found it enjoyable playing at a level similar to his/her own.
